# Conditional Probability: P(A | B)
# Conditional probability is the chance that event A happens given that event B has already happened. 
# It's written as: P(A | B) — read as "probability of A given B."

# The formula is:
# P(A | B) = P(A and B) ÷ P(B)

# This tells you: if B has already occurred, how likely is A?
# You can rearrange that formula to:
# P(A and B) = P(A | B) × P(B)
# This is helpful when you know the probability of A happening if B happens.

# 3. Find Pr(A ∩ B) - dependent case

# a) Pr(A|B) = 0.4, Pr(B) = 0.5
#Solution: Pr(A ∩ B) = Pr(B) × Pr(A|B) = 0.5 × 0.4 = 0.2

#b) Pr(A) = 0.2, Pr(B|A) = 0.1
#Solution: Pr(A ∩ B) = Pr(A) × Pr(B|A) = 0.2 × 0.1 = 0.02

#c) Pr(A|B) = 0.5, Pr(B) = 0.7
#Solution: Pr(A ∩ B) = Pr(B) × Pr(A|B) = 0.5 × 0.7 = 0.35
